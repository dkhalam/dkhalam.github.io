You can check out a few projects that I've worked on and contributed to here. If anything interests you and you'd like to learn more, I'd love to elaborate on the work and answer any questions. I enjoy collaborating and working on new challenges regularly, and my goal is to keep this page present as I generate new code. 

While a lot of the code I write professionally is found in private repositories, I do try my best to work on projects, tutorials, and demos that can be accessed publicly as well, and those can be found on my personal [GitHub](http://github.com/dkhalam) account.

### More Information

I'm still figuring things out and always looking for a new perspective on how to optimize code and get better. I wish I had all the answers, but I don't :(. If you have any additional resources or tips, please do not hesitate to reach out!
