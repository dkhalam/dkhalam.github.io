I'm a lifelong learner and problem solver with an interest in exploring the world around me. Originally from the Chicagoland area, now living in Southern California, and always looking for an adventure, I've come across so many people who have been positively impacted by greater and greater technological accessibility. My goal is to contribute to empowering applications. 

With web apps, I seek to tie in together captivating, easy to digest UX/UI, robust data-driven solutions, and sound marketing and business strategy to deliver exceptional, scalable results. I am actively looking to utilize my web development skills to impact others in a positive way. Helping people will always be the end goal.

### More Information

I'm always looking for a new perspective on how to optimize code and get better. I wish I had all the answers, but I don't :(. If you have any additional resources or tips, please do not hesitate to reach out!
